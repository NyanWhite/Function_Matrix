An Excel file with many tools, still at WIP, feedback welcome.

Support for up to 20,000 Timing,and Object data beyond this range cannot be modified and read by the tool If you want to modify beyond the supported limit.You need to manually append an existing formula column to the last Timing or Object to achieve support for exceeding the limit

However, please note that not all functions support appending formula columns by hand,and there may be bugs, so please try to stay within the supported range.
