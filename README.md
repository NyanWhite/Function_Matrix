# NyanWhite-Customizer-Mania-Tools
Sample Excel Document

---

An Excel document with many tools, still WIP, feedback welcome.

Supports up to 50,000 timings, beyond which it will be unreadable. More timings can be supported by confidently copying the formula column and adding it to the end.

## What it can do

- Expanded Timing Data

Reads data more clearly and exists as a dependency on all worksheets.

- Customize The Data Of All Items

This form allows the user to change any of the data except for the green columns, which will eventually be merged into the complete Timing.

**If you use this worksheet, then do not save the document when you exit.**

- TimingMultiplier

The worksheet is still in production so it is not available, you can download it and view it.

- BetterOffseter

Timing offsetters based on object timing are easier to use than manual input re-offsets, and also facilitate object-dependent Timing alignment without using osu!'s own object re-alignment tool in the event of >1ms deviations caused by incomplete timing divisions.

BetterOffseter can now be used in three modes other than OSUMania mode, simply by switch the version of the splitting function

V1 Or V2

Flipping the timing from bottom to top seems to have some bugs, but not a steady occurrence. The number of timings supported here relies on the amount of data imported and requires manual copying of the formula columns. B1 will give the number of valid timings, simply copy columns A,B and C to the specified number of rows. Otherwise an error will occur which will affect the normal operation of the flipper.
