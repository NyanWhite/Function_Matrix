After importing the data, there are still some manual changes to be made. This tool requires you to manually attach a formula column to invert the Timing, and the light yellow column is the finished Timing column. This is placed under [TimingPoints] in the spectrum file .osu. If you exceed the imported Timing, you will get an error and the osu will recognise it as a corrupt score file.
